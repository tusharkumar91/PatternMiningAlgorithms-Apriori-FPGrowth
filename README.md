# PatternMiningAlgorithms-Apriori-FPGrowth
Self implementation of Frequent Item set mining algorithms Apriori and FpGrowth on Adult Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)

Implementation includes:
* Apriori Implementation on Adult Dataset
* Improving Apriori by reduction in transaction and multi threading
* FPGrowth implementation
* Building a classifier using the association rules generated from Frequent itemsets.
* Also includes a Naive Bayes implementation on Adult Dataset to predict salary.

Please go through the ReadMe file in CSC440MinorProject-tusharku folder to understand how to execute the program.

A report in ACM format is also provided for the interested reader.
